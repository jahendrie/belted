2014-06-30  0.9     Initial release

2014-07-06  0.91    Added commenting to code, as well as some documentation.
                    Also made a couple of minor optimizations and added the
                    options to mute and 'manually' limit FPS to 60.

2014-07-07  0.92    Reduced the size of the source and installer distributables
                    considerably by scaling textures outside of the game and
                    converting all of the WAV sound effects to ogg.  There's a
                    touch less asteroid size variety as a result (not as much
                    room to scale around in during gameplay), but meh.  Game
                    starts up a bit quicker now, too.
