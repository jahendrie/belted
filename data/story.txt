The year is 3014, and humanity has made numerous and fantastic advancements in
all areas related to space flight and colonization.  One of the most
extraordinary of these has been the advent of the convenience stations,
waypoints in deep space that allow travellers to purchase tasty snacks and
oversized beverages -- all for low, low prices.

We join our intrepid heroes, Will and Fred, as they leave one such fuel depot in
their spaceship that coincidentally looks almost exactly like a station wagon.

"Whoa, dude!" exclaims Fred, pointing toward a nearby planet as it explodes.
Incalculable masses of rock and debris are hurled toward the pair, and the 7-11
from which they'd recently departed is destroyed in a shower of asteroids.

"Most heinous bro!", replies Will as he chucks his space-nachos out the window
of his Spacion Wagon.

Luckily for our heroes, they had just filled up on space-gas which would provide
for days' worth of fuel.  The question is this:  Can they navigate this new
asteroid belt that now bears down upon them?  Or will they let those Super Saver
fuel points go to waste?  Only time -- and skill -- will tell.

"Gnarly," croaks Fred, weakly.
"Bodacious," whispers Will in agreement, "bodacious."
